More on that later.\r\n\r\n`[target]` is an optional tmux pane number, when provided the command will be executed in the specified pane, by default it'll be done in whatever pane is active at the time.\r\n\r\n`<action>` is the kind of command you'll be translating the line to, supported actions are:\r\n\r\n* `c` - stands for `create`, you need to call this the first time you reference a window or the command will fail.\r\n* `v` - stands for `vertical split`\r\n* `h` - stands for `horizontal split`\r\n* `a` - stands for `active pane` on a given window\r\n\r\n`[command]` is an optional set of bash commands to execute in the **resulting** pane that is created by a given line.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake some time to check the [example .ta file](https://github.com/lucasefe/ta/blob/master/examples/.ta) and to play around with different configurations.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nWith [homebrew](http://brew.sh/): \r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew tap lucasefe/ta\r\nbrew install ta\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther platforms, download from [releases](https://github.com/lucasefe/ta/releases) page.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nMainly, [tmuxify](https://github.com/tonchis/tmuxify) from [Tonchis](https://github.com/tonchis)\r\n\r\n## .ta example file\r\n\r\n```\r\nwin1 c vim\r\nwin1 v foreman start\r\nwin1 h bash\r\nwin2 c tail -f log/*.log\r\nwin2 h htop\r\nwin1 a echo window win 1, will be active after all\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
